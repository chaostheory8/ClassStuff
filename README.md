# ClassStuff
Old projects from my graduate-level Bioinformatics Algorithms class, for future reference.

All .cpp files were run from command line on a unix system. Further technical specification is unavailable on account of the RIT bioinformatics server team not returning my emails asking what version of C compiler was being used.

All of these projects were at one point merely class assignments, and *for no reason* should any be used for published work/serious science.
